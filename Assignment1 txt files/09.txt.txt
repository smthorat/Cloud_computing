Cassini launched on its billion-mile journey from Earth to Saturn on Oct. 15, 1997. It was named for the astronomer Giovanni Cassini, who discovered four of the planet's moons and a gap in its rings. Cassini also carried a single passenger: The Huygens lander, built by the European Space Agency and named for the Dutch scientist who first spotted the moon Titan.

Cassini and Huygens arrived in Saturn's orbit seven years after launch, in July 2004. Several months later, Huygens split off and touched down on the shore one of Titan's lakes of liquid methane. It was humankind's first-ever landing on a moon other than our own, and the first landing of any kind in the outer solar system. Cassini, meanwhile, was the first probe to orbit Saturn. (Pioneer and Voyager had simply flown by, in 1979 and 1980, respectively.)
