Socially responsible investing is attracting more dollars than ever. In fact, following the recent developments around the Paris Climate Agreement, many investors are likely asking themselves how they can use their money to make a positive impact.
The total U.S.-domiciled assets under management using sustainable, responsible and impact strategies grew to $8.72 trillion, up from $6.57 trillion, between 2014 and 2016 — an increase of 33 percent — according to a study by the US SIF: The Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment.

As interest in sustainable and responsible investment, or SRI, continues to grow, it is important for investors to understand and evaluate the different methods available to them, set measurable goals and build a strategy for leaving a lasting legacy.
