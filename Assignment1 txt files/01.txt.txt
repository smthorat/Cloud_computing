In 10 days, NASA's Cassini spacecraft will nose-dive into Saturn and burn up in the planet's atmosphere. It's the final, suicidal step of a months-long dance through Saturn's rings that has given scientists an unprecedented view of the sixth planet from the sun. It's also the end of a mission that has revolutionized our understanding of Saturn and opened our eyes to two worlds that could be home to alien life - the moons Titan and Enceladus.

It really is the end of an era. And Cassini fans are devastated.
