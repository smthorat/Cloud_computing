Former President Barack Obama sharply criticized the Trump administration's decision to end the DACA program that protects young undocumented migrants from deportation, slamming the White House's move as a "cruel," "self-defeating" and legally unnecessary political decision.

In a post on his Facebook page, Obama defended his administration's decision to shield 800,000 undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children. The former president said he decided to use the "well-established legal principle of discretion" to protect individuals who know no home other than the United States, after Congress failed to act.
"They were brought to this country by their parents, sometimes even as infants. They may not know a country besides ours," Obama wrote. "They may not even know a language besides English. They often have no idea they're undocumented until they apply for a job, or college, or a driver's license."
