Microsoft responded strongly to the Trump administration's decision on Tuesday to move toward rescinding or replacing DACA within six months.
"There is nothing that we will be pushing on more strongly for congress to act on," Microsoft president and chief legal officer Brad Smith said in an interview with NPR. "We put a stake in the ground. We care about a tax reform bill," Smith said, noting that the entire business community cares about one but that this needs to be settled first.
Smith added that it won't be easy for the government to deport Microsoft employees who are DREAMers: "[The government's] going to have to go through us to get that person," Smith said. 

Microsoft is the latest tech company to speak out against the move. Smith made similar comments in a public letter.
