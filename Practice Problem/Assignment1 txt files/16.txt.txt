Through the 1970s and 1980s, much of the social informat-
ics research focused on organizations because they were
the major sites of computerization. It is only in the last few
years that many people who are not themselves technical
specialists have gotten computer systems for home use.
The era of the Internet, or particularly public access to the
Internet, raises issues of work at home, communication at
home, entertainment, access to medical information, and
other personal uses. These are significant phenomena, but
are different from the topics I will emphasize. They are part
of social informatics, but they open up different lines of
analysis that warrant serious study and understanding.
