Hurricane Irma, one of the most forceful Atlantic storms in a century, churned across the ocean on Tuesday on a collision course with Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, bearing down on the northern Caribbean with a devastating mix of fierce winds, surf and rain.

The eye of Irma, a Category 5 storm packing winds of 185 miles per hour (295 km per hour), was expected to sweep through the northern Leeward Islands, east of Puerto Rico, on Tuesday night or early Wednesday, en route to a Florida landfall on Saturday, the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) in Miami reported.

The threat posed to the U.S. mainland by Irma, described by NHC forecasters as a "potentially catastrophic" storm, loomed as Texas and Louisiana continued to reel from widespread destructive flooding from Hurricane Harvey.
