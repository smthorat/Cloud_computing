According to Jim Cramer, "there's always a bull market somewhere." Even in the toughest markets, Cramer's been able to find financial pockets of opportunity. He became well-known as one of the most successful money managers in Wall Street history in his 14 years managing money for his hedge fund, Cramer Berkowitz, where he generated an average annual return 24%! But how can we as individual investors get in on Cramer's success? 
Cramer's not holding any secrets to himself this time. Rather than limiting his skills to benefit only those with money under his management, Cramer is now granting subscriber access to his entire stock portfolio through membership to his investing club, Action Alerts PLUS. You'll be able to see the buy price, current price, and returns on each of his holdings immediately upon signup, as well as the analysis behind each of his trading decisions. 
Arguably the most valuable of the product offerings are the trade alerts Cramer emails you right before he makes each trade. This is a huge benefit because it allows you to so you can invest how and when he does. It's like—well, it is—getting a skilled money manager's insight, while still maintaining the control to invest as you please. He walks you through everything so that you can make the same moves as a professional money manager – without spending 30 years on Wall Street.
