Major League Baseball confirmed that the Boston Red Sox baseball team used an Apple Watch to steal hand signals from the New York Yankees, according to The New York Times.
Hand signals are used by teams for all sorts of reasons, typically to tell players when to steal bases, what kind of pitches to throw and more.
According to The New York Times, the Yankees caught on to "a member of the Red Sox training staff looking at his Apple Watch in the dugout and then relaying a message to players, who may have then been able to use the information to know the type of pitch that was going to be thrown."

If a pitcher was going to throw a fastball, for example, this member of the Boston Red Sox staff could have relayed that information to the batter.
