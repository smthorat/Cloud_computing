Meat that doesn't require the slaughter of animals. Fashion that provides an eco-friendly alternative to leather. Dairy products that are lactose-free and brewed in a lab.
Most San Franciscans aren't aware there's a lab in the heart of the financial district where scientists and entrepreneurs are working on all these things and more. The lab, which is run by a bio-technology accelerator program called IndieBio, has funded 68 early-stage start-ups.
One of its biggest successes, Memphis Meats, raised $17 million this past month for its "clean" bioreactor-brewed meat from a slew of high-profile investors, including billionaires Bill Gates and Richard Branson, Elon Musk's brother Kimball and General Electric CEO Jack Welch.

IndieBio was Memphis Meat's first investor.
