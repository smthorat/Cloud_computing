China's yuan has been on a tear all year and has now recouped last year's losses — and analysts say there's still room to run.
At its strongest level on Tuesday, the yuan was changing hands at 6.5151 against the U.S. dollar, pushing gains to more than 6 percent this year, according to Reuters data. The currency's appreciation had quickened its pace in August, marking its best month in 2017.
The yuan has strengthened much faster than expected, and it's even bucked the trend. While other Asian currencies have been falling in the face of rising political tensions between the U.S. and North Korea, the Chinese yuan has actually continued appreciating. Experts say the central bank has succeeded in demonstrating it can withstand downward pressure on the currency by tightening capital controls and with foreign exchange intervention.
