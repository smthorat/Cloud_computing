# PySpark Tutorial

## Overview
This repository contains the materials and notebooks for learning PySpark. PySpark is the Python API for Apache Spark, an open-source, distributed computing system used for big data processing and analytics. In this tutorial, we explore the fundamentals of PySpark and how it can be applied to efficiently process large datasets.

### Topics Covered
1. **Introduction to PySpark**:
   - Overview of Apache Spark and its ecosystem.
   - Setting up PySpark in local or cloud environments.
   - Understanding Spark’s architecture: SparkContext, SparkSession, RDDs (Resilient Distributed Datasets), and DataFrames.

2. **PySpark Basics**:
   - Working with RDDs (Resilient Distributed Datasets): Creation, transformations, and actions.
   - Working with DataFrames: Loading data, basic operations, filtering, and aggregation.
   - Introduction to PySpark SQL: Writing SQL queries to manipulate DataFrames.

3. **Data Manipulation and Processing**:
   - Transforming and cleaning data using PySpark’s powerful functions.
   - Understanding lazy evaluation and how PySpark optimizes execution.
   - Handling missing data, column operations, and user-defined functions (UDFs).

4. **Advanced Operations**:
   - Grouping, aggregating, and joining DataFrames.
   - Window functions for advanced analytics.
   - Working with structured and semi-structured data formats like CSV, JSON, and Parquet.

5. **Working with Big Data**:
   - How PySpark processes big data and distributes tasks across clusters.
   - Introduction to Spark’s machine learning library (MLlib) and building machine learning models.

6. **Optimization Techniques**:
   - Best practices for optimizing PySpark jobs, including caching, partitioning, and understanding the Spark execution plan.
   - Using broadcast variables and accumulators to manage resources efficiently.
