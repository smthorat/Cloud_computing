## Overview

**NYC Taxi Fare Predictor and Real-Time Trip Analyzer** is a cloud-based project designed to:
- Predict NYC taxi fares based on trip characteristics using Spark MLlib.
- Analyze trip patterns in real-time to determine high-demand areas, peak times, and popular routes.

This project demonstrates scalable data processing using Apache Spark on AWS EMR (or Google Cloud Dataproc) and includes both batch and real-time data processing capabilities.

## Features

- **Fare Prediction Model**: A machine learning model that predicts fare amounts based on distance, pickup time, and day of the week.
- **Real-Time Trip Analysis**: Analyze NYC taxi trip data in real time for insights into demand, route popularity, and time-based patterns.
- **Scalability**: Designed to run on a Spark cluster, ideal for processing large datasets with cloud resources.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this project is the **NYC Taxi Trip Record Data** available from the [NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page). For convenience, this repository includes a small sample dataset for local testing.
